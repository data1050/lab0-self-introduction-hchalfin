Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 


Hi,

My name is Harry Chalfin and I was born in Manhattan on February 5, 1998. At the age of 2, I moved to Scardale, a New York suburb, where I have lived until leaving to attend Brown as an undergraduate starting in the fall of 2016. This past May, I graduated with an Sc.B. in mathematical physics, and I am interested in possibly obtaining a Ph.D. in physics eventually. After graduation, I had been planning on finding a job in a field such as scientific research, coding, or finance, but it was exceedingly challenging to find a good job in the pandemic economy. So I have decided to invest an extra year of my time and effort into getting a master's in data science, with the hope that this program will eventually help me get a good job where I can put my coding and data science skills to good use, whether in the world of physics research or not. I am still probably going to obtain a Ph.D. in physics eventually, but I am waiting to see what course the pandemic and the economy take before deciding when to begin.

I am very excited for this program.

Best,
Harry Chalfin
